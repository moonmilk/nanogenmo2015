# nanogenmo2015
project for Darius Kazemi's national novel generation month, 2015

Inspired by Molly's monologue at the end of James Joyce's _Ulysses_: Molly Bloom checks her twitter feed. 

Download the final result here: https://github.com/moonmilk/nanogenmo2015/raw/master/mollysfeed.pdf

_searchterms.txt_ is a handmade list of phrases I came up with while reading Molly's monologue, to be used as twitter search terms. The idea was to pick phrases that have some of the flavor of the monologue but are generic enough to match a lot of stuff.

_mollysday.ipynb_ is the python notebook where the action happens, including dead ends and mistakes. After some messing around, the best result seemed to be to sort the twitter texts by decreasing lengths, so it starts slow and gets breathless by the end. Sometimes it randomly duplicates a text, to ~~disorient the reader~~ pad the word count.

_mollysfeed.html_ is the finished novel, and _mollysfeed.pdf_ is the printable version with nice margins.
